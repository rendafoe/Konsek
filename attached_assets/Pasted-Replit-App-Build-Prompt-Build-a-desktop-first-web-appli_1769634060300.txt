Replit App Build Prompt

Build a desktop-first web application with optional mobile browser support.
The app is a running-consistency companion game that integrates with third-party fitness platforms.

App Name (working)

Running Companion

Product Overview

Build a web app that rewards users for running consistently by keeping a pixel-art character alive, healthy, and visually customizable.

This app is not a fitness tracker.
It is a habit and consistency companion layered on top of existing fitness platforms.

The emotional core of the app is:

A real-world running habit directly determines the survival and legacy of a digital companion.

Authentication & Data Sources
Login Methods

OAuth via Strava (primary)

OAuth via Google (account identity only)

Users must connect at least one supported fitness provider

Supported Fitness Providers

Strava

Activity Rules

All running data must come exclusively from connected fitness providers

No manual activity entry

Minimum eligible run distance: 1 kilometer

Activities under 1 km do not count

Core Gameplay Loop

User completes a run using a connected fitness platform

Activity syncs automatically

App:

Validates distance ≥ 1 km

Updates streak and health logic

Updates character growth

Rolls for cosmetic item drops based on distance

User visits dashboard to see character state and inventory

Typical daily session: under 1 minute

Character System
Character Creation

Upon first login, automatically generate a pixel-art character

No tutorial overlay

Character immediately appears on the dashboard

Character Health States

Health is determined by consecutive days without a run, with intentional rest supported.

Day	Condition	Effect
Day 0	Run logged	Character fully nourished
Day 1	No run	Treated the same as a run (intentional rest)
Day 2	No run	Character weakens slightly
Day 3	No run	Character enters critical state
Day 4+	No run	Character dies
Growth

Growth is cosmetic only

Based on consistent days, not performance metrics

Examples:

More detailed sprite

Subtle idle animation changes

Visual posture improvements

No stats, no power, no gameplay advantages.

Death & Archive System
Permanent Death

When a character dies, it cannot be revived

Character is permanently finalized

Archive

Dead characters are stored in a user profile section called Archive

Each archived character displays:

Character sprite snapshot

Lifespan (days alive)

Total runs completed

Total distance run

Cause of death (inactivity)

Archive entries are read-only and purely historical.

New Characters

User may immediately create a new character

New characters do not reference past characters

The only persistent progression across characters is cosmetic inventory

Item & Inventory System
Item Philosophy

Cosmetic only

No gameplay advantages

Earned passively through running

Designed to create delight and surprise

Item Categories

Wearables

Hats, cloaks, boots

Nordic-inspired pixel art

Accessories

Necklaces, charms, handheld items

No environmental effects
No species shifts
No location-based drops

Distance-Based Rarity System
Core Rule

Any run of 1 km or more can roll any rarity tier, including Legendary.

Distance does not unlock rarities — it weights probabilities.

Distance Buckets

1k–5k

5k–10k

10k–15k

15k–20k

20k–30k

30k–40k

40k–50k

50k+

Example Probability Weighting (Tunable)
Distance	Common	Uncommon	Rare	Epic	Legendary
1–5k	68%	24%	6%	1.5%	0.5%
5–10k	55%	25%	13%	5%	2%
10–15k	45%	25%	18%	8%	4%
15–20k	35%	25%	22%	12%	6%
20–30k	25%	25%	28%	15%	7%
30–40k	18%	22%	30%	18%	12%
40–50k	10%	20%	32%	22%	16%
High-Distance Guarantees

50k+

Guaranteed Epic item

+1 additional roll (Rare / Epic / Legendary)

100k+

+2 additional rolls (Rare / Epic / Legendary)

Guaranteed drops stack with weighted rolls.

UI / UX Requirements
Platform Focus

Desktop-first

Mobile browser compatible

No native apps required

Visual Style

Cozy pixel art

Nordic / Scandinavian minimalism

Muted color palette

Calm animations

Plenty of whitespace

Layout

Character is always the visual focus

Health and streak clearly visible

Inventory accessible but secondary

Tone

Calm

Encouraging

Non-judgmental

Never shaming

Example copy:

“Your companion rests.”

“Your companion grows weary.”

“Your companion has passed into legend.”

Behavioral Design Constraints

Explicitly do not include:

Leaderboards

Pace comparisons

Calorie tracking

Social competition

Manual logging

This app should feel:

Supportive

Sustainable

Emotionally meaningful

Low pressure

Technical Expectations (MVP)

Frontend: modern React-based UI

Backend: simple REST or serverless architecture

OAuth-based authentication

Database tables for:

Users

Characters

Activities

Items

Inventory

Archive entries

Pixel art assets may be placeholders initially

System should be easy to iterate on post-MVP

Build this app with clean, readable code, sensible defaults, and clear separation of concerns.
Optimize for correctness, clarity, and future extensibility rather than over-engineering.
